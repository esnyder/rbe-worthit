Purpose: Provide a non-technical friendly tool for Rogue Book Exchange 
(www.roguebooks.org) volunteers to easily sort incoming book donations
and determine which ones are worth listing for sale.

Installation: 

* Place the isbnsearch.py script in your cgi-bin (/usr/lib/cgi-bin
by default for apache2 on ubuntu)

* Place a copy of amazon.keys.template in /etc/apache2/amazon.keys with your keys.

* Create the (empty) shelve file in your cgi-bin directory by running the python
shell, doing 'import shelve; d = shelve.open('isbnsearch.dat'); d.close()', then
moving it to /usr/lib/cgi-bin and chown'ing it to the user your web server runs as.
